# Finishing the network split


.... I had issue , and for some reason the server is not responding to anything
the client is doing, so i'm deciding to put the networking on hold for now...

I'll go back to the gameplay so today i want to do the following things:

* Implements Weapon with firing rate
* Implements Windows breaking


## Good time with weapon.


* First the user gonna have multiple slot for weapons.
* Start the game with the basic pistol as a weapon.
* Weapon has the following component.
  * Ammunitions
    * Magasine Size
    * Limit number of magasine
  * FiringRate
  * ReloadingTime


Yes it's all done, except for the multiple slot thing ,
i have the possibilit to switch but i have issue right
now when i spawn multiple weapon.

I will continue on this when i'll add weapon to buy.
