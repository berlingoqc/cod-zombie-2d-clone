## Doing some little work in my off time


I realise that the map is not displaying in the web version of the app
when it was deploy to the github page.

Not really sure why , i got the warning for the COPY thing of the textures
in the log and when i go the to network tab i see the data get loaded
and in the log. So the texture seem the be render but not displaying,
not sure, i'm not gonna stress to mutch about this for now. it's nice
to have integrate the library but i want to work on the base gameplay
before focusing more on the map.


So for today my first goal is to setup the
[fast compilation](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/#enable-fast-compiles-optional)
and the scene loading to see more about the blezing fast hot reload i readed about
in the home page, because with this i hope to have a nice and fast workflow because
i don't think i will be able to achieve my goal without this.

So i made the following change:

* Add nightly toolchain
* Create a new make target `run-dyn` for development purpose for
dynamic linking
* I start using `lld` on my arch linux machine.

Before when i was doing a simple change like changing a string
in the code the build time was around `6-7s` now it's `1-1.5s`
so great improvement.

New step in to use scene to put all the information about the
game to no have to rebuild to app to make a change to the design
and value of the property of the objects.

Ohh my god , the lack of documentation for anything more than really basic
is starting to get to me. I had a hard time figuring how to load my level
from a file and re-render it every time it's changing.

First i got it to work but without the hot-reload and at the end both
where working fine.

The process is the following,
* Create a custom asset loader for my type
    * Using ron the deserialize it
* Create a startup system that load my map data and start the live reload
* Create a system to render the map when it's not rendered and the data is loaded
* Create a system to listen to change on my asset server: on modifed despawn my map and set the rendering state to false

With this is working, the next step is the following:

* Clean my map code and create a plugin to render the map
* Add the map file path too to be created with the map
