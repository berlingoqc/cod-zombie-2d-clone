## Come on we need some sprite


OK so i decide that the color cube had to go.

It's time to integrate some sprite sheet and
to have a basic animation system inside the
application.

All the code for the animation and sprite sheet
are gonna recide in the client code so the server
will spawn the entity and the client will have
code to react and apply the texture and sprite
to the entity.

Yeah it took me a little while but i was able to implement a basic
animation system for the character , that i will have to open a
little bit to use the same component and system for the zombie
but it will not work for now because it's to mutch user centric.

I don't really like the way i handle my weapons , it's hard to get
the equip weapon and it's configuration.

But what i have is a file to configure the animations of my user,
i will be able to use the same for the animation configuration
of the zombies.

Yes , i think i'm starting to do things better, the entity component system
is really fun to use.

I was able to use the same code for both the sprite animation and for the
sprite rotation using component to target the item.

So for now all the code to manage the sprite and animation is control on
system on the client but all the event management for the animation are
manage in the server code.
