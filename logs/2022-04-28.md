## Come on we need some sprite


OK so i decide that the color cube had to go.

It's time to integrate some sprite sheet and
to have a basic animation system inside the
application.

All the code for the animation and sprite sheet
are gonna recide in the client code so the server
will spawn the entity and the client will have
code to react and apply the texture and sprite
to the entity.
