## Starting to look at multiplayer.

I have start to look at the library : `https://github.com/smokku/bevy_networking_turbulence`
which seem to be perfect for my use case , support UDP and WebRTC but for what i understand
you start the serveur for WebRTC ou UDP , so the client playing on desktop would not be able
to play with the one on the web.

I have fork the library to update it to bevy `0.7.0` , i had issue with the exemple so
i deleted them and i'm gonna start to rebuild the app for networking.

From what i'v seen people do , i will split my code base in three crate.

* client (Client code)
* server (Serveur instance running bevy loop and managing entity replication)
* shared (Shared code between the two, mostly surcture)


I propably won't have time to start this today but it's nice to start the process
and i have integrate the `NetworkingPlugin` from my fork and my app is still building
so it's promissing.
