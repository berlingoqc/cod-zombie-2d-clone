## Starting the project

I havent readed a lot of the documentation and havent done mutch planing
like i always do. I will see how thing are evolving during the development.

I don't have mutch time today but my goals are to:

* Create the base of the project.
* Create building scripts.
* Open a window and display something.



### Steps


I'm basically gona follow the step from bevy-robbo project and the unoffical guide.

* Copy is dependency
* Copy is makefile


[WORKING]

Finally i didnt not use the exact setup with the dependency to wgpu and webgl2
because they where failing to build using the lastest 0.6.1 release of Bevy.

Going well i have a working application in the browser and in the desktop
that display a window and print hello world. Got for now.

The next step for will be to introduce like in the bevy-robbo project the following:
    * A benchmarking mode
    * A debug mode
    * FPS counter

[WORKING]

Done i made a simple FPS counter and adding it as a plugin , sweet.
Now i want to publish my site to github pages with github actions.

[WORKING]

It's was pretty easy to setup. https://berlingoqc.github.io/cod-zombie-2d-clone/

The next step i want to do is making a basic map with the map editor, import in
the application and display it.

Let's goooooooooooo

[WORKING]

Ehhh small issue , the bevy-tiled library does not support 0.6.0.
Try to make the migration but way to many issue and i dont know
the framework well enought.

Soo i'll try something else. Just to draw a square as the map.

[WORKING]

I did it , i draw a rectangle and i little square that i can control.
Next step is to put boundary on the maps to not go outside and maybe
fire some ammunition.

So i'm gonna make the following entity:


* Map
    * Inside floor
    * Outside floor
    * Wall (prevent the use to go further)
    * Windows (the place where zombie will go)
