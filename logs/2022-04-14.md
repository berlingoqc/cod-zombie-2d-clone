## Starting the project

I havent readed a lot of the documentation and havent done mutch planing
like i always do. I will see how thing are evolving during the development.

I don't have mutch time today but my goals are to:

* Create the base of the project.
* Create building scripts.
* Open a window and display something.



### Steps


I'm basically gona follow the step from bevy-robbo project and the unoffical guide.

* Copy is dependency
* Copy is makefile


[WORKING]

Finally i didnt not use the exact setup with the dependency to wgpu and webgl2
because they where failing to build using the lastest 0.6.1 release of Bevy.

Going well i have a working application in the browser and in the desktop
that display a window and print hello world. Got for now.

The next step for will be to introduce like in the bevy-robbo project the following:
    * A benchmarking mode
    * A debug mode
    * FPS counter
