[WORKING]

During the night, i finish the wall collision and the shooting of ammunition, very very basic
but it's working. The ammunition should collide with the collider and be destroy after some distance cross
or time.

[WORKING]

This morning , I waste some of my time on `bevy_tiled` like a total idiot, got it to compile and run
but the missing part was the shaders... so i look around and the author have switch
to a new library more universal that also support tiled.

So here i am moving to `brevy_ecs_tilemap` instead, got it to work, so i'm gonna use the exemple
for tiled and integrate it in my project for the floor.

[WORKING]

Yeah it's working ,  i copy there helper function and there map. Very dirty copy and paste.
Next time i'm working i need to clean the code and integrate this with the scene feature
for hot reloading of the placement of the map and my walls.

The update for 0.7.0 for bevy was release today i made the update and it's working
with the tiled library already supporting it . sweet.

I realize that the build was not working for wasm due to a optional dependencies
of tiled, took me a while to figure it out. Grrr i was working in the exemple but
not for me, i was missing the `default-features: = false` lol.

Peace out for today.
