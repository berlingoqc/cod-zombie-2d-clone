I complete what i start yesterday with the window reparation working properly.


The window panel take time to repair and if you go too far or release the
button the ingoing reparation stop and when one is over and you keep
the trigger the next one start reparing.

I just need to have a better separation in my code for the code that
trigger the player interaction and the differents implementation
of the different interaction, because the way i did it , it will
sooon because unmanagable.


Also i need to have the interaction value for the window be in 
the config file for the map.

### A little clean up in the assets

Ok so now i will do a clean up of the repository on my asset folder.
i will add a better layout and i will add the option that i wanted for
the map , in the game mode settings not in the map.

So i guess that window are gonna spawn normally and when the zombie
level is started i will have to query all existing windows to apply
the config, yeah soo fun.

[WORKING]

Yeah so now i have remaps the assets in the following structure

* fonts (the fonts lol)
* game (contains level information)
* maps (contains the map asset and game info)
* weapons (contains the weapon list and there assets in seperate folder)

Also , i implement a event for the request to restart the game, so 
now the game restart when the game level config is updated or when
you press `F1`.

Also , i changed the file type for my asset they will all have the
following name struture: `.{type}.ron`, like:

* `easy.level.ron`
* `iso_map.asset.ron`
