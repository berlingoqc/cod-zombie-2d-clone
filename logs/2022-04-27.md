I complete what i start yesterday with the window reparation working properly.


The window panel take time to repair and if you go too far or release the
button the ingoing reparation stop and when one is over and you keep
the trigger the next one start reparing.

I just need to have a better separation in my code for the code that
trigger the player interaction and the differents implementation
of the different interaction, because the way i did it , it will
sooon because unmanagable.


Also i need to have the interaction value for the window be in 
the config file for the map.
