## Integration of bevy gamepad support

Until the beginning of my game all controle where hard coded in the code that handle the logic.

I need to do two things with my controller code:

* Split it inside the client code.
* Send the client code action to the shared code.

* Use abstraction to handle gamepad and input for each player

For now i will only two the second one for the gamepad and latter on i will split the input and the
logic code. Also i need to prepare my code for local multiplayer and replace all the case that handle
ressource considering that only one set can exists , of the player one, but it all need to loop on each
player.



### Starting gamepad support

I added issue at first to get things to work. I try to integrate the events but none where triggering.
All because inside my `Cargo.yaml` i had `default-features: false` so the package that i needed for 
gamepad support `bevy_gilrs` was not compilling. I added it and now it's working fine.


So what i did is a written a small struct with an implementation similar to Input<> of bevy that
contains a reference to all input source needed and depending on the player configure and it's 
input configuration to get the input event.

I then write a ugly as fuck typealias with an tuple to store the mapping for each type on controller
and i use this.

```rust
pub type GameButton = (KeyCode, MouseButton, GamepadButtonType);

pub const CHANGE_WEAPON_BTN: GameButton = (KeyCode::Tab, MouseButton::Middle, GamepadButtonType::North);
pub const RELOAD_WEAPON_BTN: GameButton = (KeyCode::R, MouseButton::Right, GamepadButtonType::West);
pub const FIRED_WEAPON_BTN: GameButton = (KeyCode::Space, MouseButton::Left, GamepadButtonType::RightTrigger);
pub const INTERACTION_BTN: GameButton = (KeyCode::F, MouseButton::Other(0), GamepadButtonType::South);

pub struct PlayerInputs<'a> {
    pub keyboard_input: &'a Res<'a,Input<KeyCode>>,
    pub buttons_mouse: &'a Res<'a, Input<MouseButton>>,
    pub buttons_gamepad: &'a Res<'a, Input<GamepadButton>>,

    pub current_controller: &'a PlayerCurrentInput,
}

impl <'a> PlayerInputs <'a> {

    pub fn pressed(&self, button: &GameButton) -> bool {
        return if self.current_controller.input_source == SupportedController::Keyboard {
            return self.keyboard_input.pressed(button.0) || self.buttons_mouse.pressed(button.1);
        } else {
            let gamepad_button = GamepadButton(self.current_controller.gamepad.unwrap(), button.2);
            return self.buttons_gamepad.pressed(gamepad_button);
        }
    }

    pub fn just_pressed(&self, button: &GameButton) -> bool {
        return if self.current_controller.input_source == SupportedController::Keyboard {
            return self.keyboard_input.just_pressed(button.0) || self.buttons_mouse.just_pressed(button.1);
        } else {
            let gamepad_button = GamepadButton(self.current_controller.gamepad.unwrap(), button.2);
            return self.buttons_gamepad.just_pressed(gamepad_button);
        }
    }
}
```

What i need to do is have to only receive the Input source but it's more complicated and i would have to deal
with dynamic implementation so i did this simple solution instead for now. Very not clean but it does the job.

Also i modified my `LookingAt` component to have a mode with instead of receive a point where you look it's only
a direction of where you are looking at. Usefull for my gamepad support to translate the mouse point location to
the right joystick.
