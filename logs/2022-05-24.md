Starting back the project. I was in vacation for the month of may in brazil.

## Make the game running at the same speed regardless of framerate

One thing that i didn't consider at first is the make the movement of my character
consistent with frame rate.

I added a component to register the current frame rate and i'm using it in the movement
calculation of the player and bullet, the rest are based on timer that should be consistent
with the framerate.

Also with this i add architecture specific code block to have the fps lock a 60 on native
and 30 on web, but the game on my macbook pro is only running at 24 fps on firefox using
the integrated graphics card instead of the discrete graphic card.

## Refactor and split of code

Thing that i should do earlier , split the code more before reaching big file hard to work on.

## Now it's time to fix the akward collision

For now the player and the zombie don't have collider so they can all be jam together and
the same thing for the window the zombie are just getting in the same space.
