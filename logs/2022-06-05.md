In the client code when starting a zombie game i configure the list of player in the game and the controller they
use.


Things to rework to get this to work.

* Need to rework the way the zombie select there target (pick the player) [X]
* Need to rescope the query on weapons to only look for weapon of the player not all weapons [X]
* Need to redo the in game ui to have stat of all the player. [X]
* Need to rework the end of game event triggering. Both player need to be dead now. [ ]
* Need to rework the way to player spawn to not all be at the same point. [ ]
