## Continuing weapon

* I need to fix the issue when i try to add two gun and the second one is not working.
* After i want to add a spreading value for weapon ( like for the precision of the weapon )
* Implements a shotgun with multiple bullet being spawn ( need to configure the sprite to be smaller)


[WORKING]

Yes it's done for the switching of weapon , it was very strange , i was using a boolean in the struct of the state
of the weapon to tell if it was active or not but when i was changing this state the qery was not returning the
newly activate weapon no more. So i switch to using the enum of the WeaponState and add a `Hide` state to tell
that the weapon is hide and not in use. Only one can have the `Firing` state , telling that this is the use
weapon.

After that i was able to add the spreading of the value , with two random value between (-offset..offset)
that are increment to x and y of the normalize vector. A value of `15` (0.15) give a nice spread for a
gun like a small mitraillette.

Also i implement live reloading for the weapon allowing to work on the configuration.

Time to implement the shotgun.

For the shotgun i'm gonna add the two following property on my weapon.

* TriggerAmmunition: number of ammunition fire each time you press FIRE !!
* SpreadingBullet : a structure for bullet that spread in multiple bullet
* Sprite information : information of the size of the sprite


[WORKING]

Yes i did it all, it's all working great so now i have what is required for:

* Manual weapon
* Shotgun style weapon
* Automatic style weapon

The next thing that i could do is to implement raffal gun like the Famas
and add custom speed for weapon.

Both most importantly i need to fix this issue on bullet passing throught
wall when there is to many bullet
