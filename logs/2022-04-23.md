# Starting to implement the networking


Yeah , i'm kinda lost with the networking. It seem like hard
work to implement for the first time correctly. But i feel
it's very important right now because i want to structure my
code in the future for this.


## Interlude hot reloading server

I lost so time because things were not working because of me
and because i hardcoded some value requiring multiple change
when changing build target instead of one.... will i ever learn.

I found the perfect server for hot reloading. [live-server](http://tapiov.net/live-server/http://tapiov.net/live-server/)
Require npm , would have love to stay rust centric but i do
so mutch npm on other project i'm already set up.

Also i copy paste some code the make the canvas big as the window
in wasm. I prefer this way and i'll need to integrate the fullscreen
toggle from inside the code later on.


## What are the message that need to be communicate

Server:
* Send zombie game state
* Send zombie spawn
* Send zombie movement
* Receive user input
    * Create entity for user input
    * Handle despawning of entity like zombie.

Client:
* Receive zombie game state from server
* Receive zombie spawn / despawn event
* Receive zombie movement
* Send user input
* Spawn entity broadcasted by server


1. The serveur when started, immediaty start a game in the waiting state,
waiting for user connection.
2. Receive player ready event.
3. When all connected player have send ready event, start the game.


## First step moving to shared

I move my code the shared for the game logic because the server
and the client gonna use those structure to send and communicate
the state of the game. I just copy everything for now and will
progressively move thing that are not required for both in the good
crate.
