I'm leaving for a month of vacation in Brazil soo this is my last 
modification for a long time.

## Add main menu

i added a game menu, pretty straight forward , i added 
system when state are changing to remove map element and
reset the game state.

But i added to many system that all do the samething.
I will rework to only have one query to remove every element.
With a component name something like ZombieGameEntity.


* `F1` restart the game
* `F2` return to main menu
