## I still have an issue with collision

When the zombie wanna cross the destroy window , they just teleport
to the other side after some akward step. I need to fix this.

The first option that i was thinking of is to add property to the
collision element to allow specific type of character to cross
this element when it's at true.

Other option would be to disable the collision on the zombie
for the time he cross the window i guess.


### What i did

So finnally i added a destroy property on the window (could maybe a Component at some point).
And when they are attack or repair by the user the state of destroy change and i added a system
to react on change on this field to change the value for the accepted character type for the collision
of the window.

So now when they are destroy the zombie can pass throw but now the player.

This is ok but the next things that i need to clear and implement more is the health system and handling
on this.
