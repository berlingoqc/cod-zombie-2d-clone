# New day , new issue

[WORKING]

I start my game natively and the game was laggy like shit.
Took me a while to figure it out but the compiler was telling
me why all along , sorry rustc shound not have ignore your
sweet warning. My profile with optimisation where no being
apply because you need to put them in the crate root ....

It's funny without optimisation it's totally unplayable even
in this early stage.

I have wayyyy to mutch warning , important stuff can get lost
in all those unused imports , time for so cleanup my dude.


[WORKING]

I did my best but it's hard and useless to remove them all.

So for the real stuff my goal today is too lay the ground
at the networking stack for the project.

[WORKING]

Mmmmmg i was trying to make the connection work between
my server and my client use WebRTC but it does not seem
to be working ... I was about to moving to something else
because i want progress today not getting stuck. So i
decide to test in the web and it's working fine. So
maybe it's no suppose to work in native. I'm trying
to make it work via udp but i have compilation issue
with the features `use-udp`.

So i'm gonna develop using the web for the multiplayer i guess,
cannot use bevy_dyn but at least the compile time is pretty
fast but i would need to setup a web development setup
with hot-reload when the js and wasm are generated...

After some Halo 2 with my friend.
