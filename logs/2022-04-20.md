# New day , new issue

[WORKING]

I start my game natively and the game was laggy like shit.
Took me a while to figure it out but the compiler was telling
me why all along , sorry rustc shound not have ignore your
sweet warning. My profile with optimisation where no being
apply because you need to put them in the crate root ....

It's funny without optimisation it's totally unplayable even
in this early stage.

I have wayyyy to mutch warning , important stuff can get lost
in all those unused imports , time for so cleanup my dude.

I did my best but it's hard and useless to remove them all.

So for the real stuff my goal today is too lay the ground
at the networking stack for the project.
