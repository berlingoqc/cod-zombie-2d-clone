## The start of something new


### Introduction 

A new year a new project. (4 months too late)

I start programming to learn the craft on how to make video game.

I even when to a school that put focus in that learning OpenGL and
Unreal Engine 4 as a end of program projects. But like all my
friends and collegue , we all went where to work is steady and
the money is easy ... in web development , working on backend ,
frontend and CI/CD. For myself i work as a DevOps backend developer
for a big compagny , deploying spring boot application in EKS and
porting legacy tomcat war application. What i dream.

But the project of making a video game has never left my mind ever since.
Since we made a moba with VR capability as the final project of my program.
We plan on continuate it but all stop when we all split up and went our ways.

1 year later i work for like 2 day on copy a exemple of a doom like 3d exemple
for godot and making it a call of duty zombie like game but with simpler graphics.

After me first road bump i stop and never went back. Spent the last 2 years
developing professional skills i went to go back to making a simple video game.

I love the zombie killing gameplay introduce by the Call Of Duty series
startig in the World at War game.

And i went to make a free , open and accessible version that everybody
could pick up and play.


## What i want from this game

I want to following:

* Accessible very simply without installation (wasm baby)
* Low ressource requirement
* Being made with 100% open source technology
* Replicate the gameplay elements of the zombie mode.
* Only with the keyboard or a controller (no mouse)
* The game will be a 2D topdown of a DOOM like style. (not sure already)


Inspiration for the style of game:

* Enter the gungeon (love it)
* Binding of isaac (love it)
* Nuclear throne (love it)
* Hyper parasite (never play)
* Zombie Shooter (never play) but love the orthogolane

Inspiration for the game mode:

* Call of Duty Black Ops zombie 
* Killing Floor 2 (my girlfriend favorite)


## What engine to pick

What really got me in the mod for this is seeing the release of Unreal Engine 5, wow , that's awsome and
i would love to dive and play into that it's not reallistic to use it with my goal with my game.
I need a smaller game engine and good support for web assembly.

Only two things really made the cut:

* Bevy
* Godot (3) (the 4.0 version does not have support for wasm atm)

And i decide to start looking into Bevy , i really like what i saw at first glence but i need to read the book
first and start to look on what would be missing if i want to accomplish my goal for this game.


## What i have to learn first

* [bevy book](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/)
* [more book](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/)
* [bevy exemple](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#2d-rendering)
* [good starting point](https://grapeprogrammer.com/rust-rungun-game-bevy/)
* [wasm starting point](https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo)

* [awsome bevy](https://github.com/zkat/awesome-bevy)
